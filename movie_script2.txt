immersive experience you’ve ever
known.

CUT TO: A woman wipes away tears.
WOMAN (TESTIMONIAL)
I never thought I’d hear my
mother’s voice again... She passed
when I was four. But now, I can sit
with her. Talk to her. It’s like
she’s really here.

FLASH TO: A VR headset being placed over someone’s eyes. The
screen goes black—then suddenly bursts into life. A WEDDING
CEREMONY unfolds in breathtaking realism.

CUT BETWEEN:
• A family album with black-and-white photographs.
• The same faces now animated, speaking, laughing.
• A person walking on a treadmill in the soundstage.
• The same person, now inside the wedding, shaking hands,
taking a glass of champagne from a robotic waiter.

SPOKESMAN (V.O.)
A seamless blend of AI and human
memory, making the past as real as
the present.

QUICK CUTS:

• Rows of workers at high-tech workstations.
• AI-generated faces rendered with exquisite precision.
• Massive NORAD-style computer banks processing endless data.
BACK TO VR USER: They remove the goggles. The wedding

vanishes. They are back in the sterile soundstage, misty-
eyed, overwhelmed.

TEXT ON SCREEN:

“Reconnect. Remember. Relive.”

FADE TO BLACK.
END OF TV SPOT
A man—our protagonist—Ethan Montague, a writer living in a
cramped apartment filled with the storied artifacts of a time
gone by, framed photographs, newspaper articles, Life
Magazines, gathers documents, photographs, and artifacts from
a famous family.
The Charles Montague estate. “At home with the Montagues” A
Life magazine spread from the 1930s shows a legendary

• The system processes it.
• The past comes alive.

A flickering transition from sepia-toned history to full-
color reality. The grand estate party reborn. Ethan opens the

door much like Dorothy opening the door to OZ into this dream
come true.

EXT. MONTAGUE LAKESIDE ESTATE – LATE AFTERNOON
Ethan makes his way through famous guests—30’s movie stars,
political figures, Charles Lindbergh, Henry Ford, and Thomas
Edison—all dressed in their finest, sipping champagne and
enjoying the sprawling estate.
INT. FAMILY REUNION SOUND STAGE

Behind the scenes, match action with the above—Ethan wears hi-
tech wireless VR goggles, cutting back and forth between

shaking hands with a robot and interacting at the grand
party.
CHARLES MONTAGUE, late 50s, imposing, sinister, and
imperious, walks right in front of Ethan, stopping him cold,
glass of champagne in hand.

CHARLES MONTAGUE
And who might you be, young man?

Ethan shakes his head, nervous at meeting his virtual great-
grandfather, stumbling over his words.

ETHAN

Well, I’m Ethan—Ethan Montague,
your great-grandson.
Charles erupts in a booming laugh.
CHARLES MONTAGUE
Great-grandson? I don’t have any
great-grandchildren. How old do you
think I am, anyway?

Charles, still laughing, motions to his wife, SOPHIA, late
30s.

CHARLES MONTAGUE (CONT’D)
Sophia, come here! I want you to
meet your great-grandson.

SOPHIA
(smacking his arm)
Charles, how much have you been
drinking?

CHARLES MONTAGUE
Why don’t you show our youngest
family member around?

Ethan, led by the lovely Sophia, takes in the surroundings.
Match action to the same moment on the Family Reunion stage.
INT. FAMILY REUNION SOUND STAGE
Ethan removes his goggles as the simulation freezes. He turns
to HENRY HILL, a Steve Jobs-type CEO of Family Reunion and
spokesman of the infomercial.
HENRY

So... what did you think?

Ethan, visibly shaken.
ETHAN

I’m literally blown away. It’s
incredible—really incredible. Man,
I’m so hooked.
HENRY

So I guess you’ll be coming back,
then? If you find any more
material, keep it coming. The AI
simulations only get better and
better.

ETHAN

Oh my God, you can count on it.

FADE OUT.
MONTAGE:
Ethan poring over books, journals, video tapes, YouTube
videos, 60 Minutes-style documentaries, furiously inputting
data.
MOVIE TRAILER ANNOUNCER (V.O.)It starts as pure fun... then
intrigue... then murder, as cross-referenced material reveals
that an often-repeated conspiracy theory becomes deadly
reality.

Family dinners turning into heated arguments.
A chair smashing.
A little boy hidden behind a doorway, witnessing something
shocking.

screens, blinking lights of mainframes processing data.

INT. MONTAGUE MUSEUM – MODERN DAY

The once-grand family home, now a tour-driven Hearst Castle-
like museum.

ELIZABETH MONTAGUE, intense and angry, argues with Ethan.

ELIZABETH

You know you can’t tell a soul,
right?

ETHAN

Are you kidding? I’m going to tell
everyone. You can’t hide this.

In a setup mirroring the earlier scene, a figure violently
tumbles down the grand staircase, landing with a sickening
thud.

FADE TO BLACK.
