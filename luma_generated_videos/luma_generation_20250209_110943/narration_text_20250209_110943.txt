In a world where memories can be more than just remembered, Family Reunion offers the impossible - a chance to step back through time. Through groundbreaking AI and virtual reality, the past springs to vivid life, allowing people to walk among their cherished memories and lost loved ones.

For Ethan Montague, this technological marvel becomes an obsession when he discovers he can recreate his family's legendary 1930s lakeside estate gatherings. Among the glittering guests and flowing champagne, he comes face to face with his great-grandfather Charles, a commanding presence whose charm masks something darker beneath.

As Ethan delves deeper into his family's history, inputting every scrap of information he can find, the AI simulations reveal disturbing inconsistencies. What begins as an innocent exploration of his heritage transforms into something far more sinister. Hidden behind the facade of wealth and sophistication, a decades-old conspiracy begins to surface.

Through vintage photographs, forgotten documents, and fragments of truth, Ethan uncovers a web of secrets that his family has desperately tried to bury. At the heart of it all lies a tragic incident - a young woman's fatal fall down the grand staircase of the Montague estate.

Now, as past and present collide in the halls of the family museum, Ethan faces a choice: keep his family's dark secret buried, or expose the truth that has haunted generations of Montagues.
