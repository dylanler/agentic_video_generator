In a world where the past can be perfectly recreated, Family Reunion promises the impossible - a chance to step back in time and embrace lost loved ones once more. Through cutting-edge AI and virtual reality, memories become reality.

For Ethan Montague, it begins as an innocent exploration of his family's gilded history. At a legendary 1930s gathering, he comes face to face with his great-grandfather Charles, the patriarch of a dynasty built on secrets.

But as Ethan delves deeper, inputting endless data into the system, something darker emerges. Behind the champagne and laughter, a sinister truth lies buried in time. Old photographs reveal new questions. Family videos expose hidden horrors.

A young woman's fatal fall. A child's traumatic witness. Blood on marble stairs, both past and present.

Now Ethan must choose between preserving his family's carefully constructed facade or exposing a truth that's haunted generations. In this game of virtual reality and very real consequences, some memories are better left forgotten.
