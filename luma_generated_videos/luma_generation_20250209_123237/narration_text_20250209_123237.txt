For some, like Sarah Chen, it means one more chance to embrace a lost loved one. Her tears tell a story of joy and healing that words alone cannot express. Through our virtual reality interface, families reunite across decades, sharing precious moments that time once stole away.

But for Ethan Marshall, his research into the Montague estate reveals darker truths. In his cluttered apartment, surrounded by yellowing magazines and faded photographs, he uncovers a web of secrets spanning generations. The glamorous fa√ßade of 1930s high society masks a sinister undercurrent.

As he steps into our simulation of the grand Montague estate, Ethan finds himself amid glittering parties and famous faces. Yet beneath the champagne and laughter, violence echoes through time. A woman's fatal fall down the mansion's grand staircase haunts both past and present.

Now, in the preserved halls of the Montague Museum, history threatens to repeat itself. Elizabeth Montague confronts Ethan, their heated argument illuminated by flashes of lightning. The same staircase that witnessed tragedy decades ago becomes the stage for a modern-day revelation that will shake both families to their core.

Some memories are meant to stay buried. Others demand to be brought into the light.
