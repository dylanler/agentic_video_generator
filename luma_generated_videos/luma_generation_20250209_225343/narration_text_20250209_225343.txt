But for Ethan Montague, this window to the past reveals more than just cherished memories. His research into his own family history uncovers a web of secrets hidden beneath the polished veneer of wealth and privilege.

At a glorious summer party in 1930, the Montague estate sparkles with champagne and laughter. Yet something darker lurks behind the facade. As Ethan delves deeper, he discovers a tragic death that was never meant to be found – a young woman's fatal fall that echoes through decades of silence.

Now, in the halls of the Montague Museum, history threatens to repeat itself. Elizabeth Montague guards her family's secrets with ruthless determination. As past and present collide on those same marble stairs, blood once again stains the floor where old sins cast long shadows.

Some memories are meant to stay buried. Some truths refuse to die. Welcome to Family Reunion, where the past isn't just remembered – it's reborn.
