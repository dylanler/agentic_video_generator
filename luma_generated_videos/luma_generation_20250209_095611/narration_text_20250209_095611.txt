In a world where the past is no longer out of reach, Family Reunion offers the ultimate promise - to reconnect with lost loved ones through groundbreaking AI and virtual reality. 

For Ethan Montague, a writer obsessed with his family's storied history, this technology opens a door to 1930s high society, where his great-grandfather's lakeside estate once hosted the elite of politics and entertainment.

What begins as an innocent exploration of family memories takes a sinister turn. As Ethan delves deeper into the simulation, he uncovers long-buried secrets that some would prefer stay hidden. Behind the champagne toasts and elegant parties lies a dark conspiracy, one that echoes through generations.

Through countless hours of research and virtual immersion, Ethan pieces together a shocking truth about his family's past. But knowledge comes at a price. As the line between past and present begins to blur, he faces a chilling choice - keep his ancestor's secrets, or risk everything to expose a murder that changed his family forever.

In Family Reunion, some memories are better left forgotten.
