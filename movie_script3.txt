FAMILY REUNION - 1 MINUTE TEASER

FADE IN:

QUICK CUTS between pristine VR lab equipment and vintage photographs:

A sleek VR headset being lifted...
An old, sepia-toned family photo from the 1930s...
DNA strands spinning on a holographic display...

SPOKESMAN (V.O.)
(smooth, professional)
What if you could step into your family's past?

INT. FAMILY REUNION LAB - DAY
ETHAN MONTAGUE (30s) stands on an omnidirectional treadmill, 
wearing a VR headset. His hands reach out, touching things we 
can't see.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. MONTAGUE ESTATE - 1930s
The same reaching motion, but now Ethan's hand grasps a 
crystal champagne glass. He's surrounded by elegantly dressed 
figures from the past - movie stars, politicians, the elite 
of the 1930s.

CHARLES MONTAGUE (V.O.)
(sinister undertone)
And who might you be, young man?

QUICK CUTS:
- Computer screens flooding with data
- A woman falling down grand stairs
- Blood spreading across marble
- Ethan ripping off his VR headset, horrified
- Ancient newspaper headlines flashing: "MONTAGUE MYSTERY REMAINS UNSOLVED"

ELIZABETH (V.O.)
(urgent whisper)
You know you can't tell a soul.

FINAL SHOT: The VR headset lies broken on the floor, still 
flickering with images of the past.

TEXT APPEARS: "Some memories should stay buried."

FADE TO BLACK.
