Here's a cohesive summary of the movie script:

"Family Reunion" is a thriller that begins with a teaser trailer showcasing groundbreaking technology that allows people to relive past moments through an advanced combination of AI, VR, and robotics. The company, called Family Reunion, promises to recreate deceased loved ones and historical moments with perfect detail.

The main story follows Ethan Montague, a writer who uses this technology to investigate his own family history, specifically focusing on a famous 1930s gathering at the Charles Montague estate. During his first VR experience, he meets his great-grandfather Charles Montague and Charles' wife Sophia at an elegant party attended by historical figures like Charles Lindbergh, Henry Ford, and Thomas Edison.

Impressed by the technology, Ethan becomes obsessed with diving deeper into his family's past, encouraged by Henry Hill, the Steve Jobs-like CEO of Family Reunion. As Ethan continues his research and feeds more historical data into the system, he begins to uncover something sinister - what appears to be a murder mystery involving his family.

The story takes a dark turn as Ethan discovers what seems to be a real conspiracy theory turned deadly reality. This leads to confrontations with family members, particularly Elizabeth Montague, who wants to keep whatever Ethan has discovered a secret. The script suggests violent incidents both past and present, including someone falling down a grand staircase in both time periods, implying a pattern of violence in the family's history.

The story appears to blend elements of historical drama, technological thriller, and murder mystery, questioning how much of the past should remain buried and the consequences of uncovering long-hidden family secrets through advanced technology.
