Film Treatment: Family Reunion
Genre:
Sci-Fi Mystery / Family Drama
LOGLINE:
A young man from a once-iconic family uses a cutting-edge AI service to reconnect with his deceased
relatives in a VR recreation of their storied past. But when he unearths evidence of a long-buried crime,
he finds himself targeted by his ambitious cousin, desperate to protect the family’s pristine legacy at all
costs.
ACT ONE: Discovering the Family Reunion Service
Opening Scene:
Ethan Montague, a modest history teacher in his late 20s, sifts through boxes of family heirlooms in his
cramped apartment. Despite his famous last name, Ethan has no connection to the legacy of power and
privilege that once defined the Montague family. His parents passed away when he was young, and the
rest of his family’s wealth and fame vanished before his birth. On a whim, Ethan decides to try Family
Reunion, a groundbreaking AI Company promising fully immersive VR recreations of deceased relatives
using DNA, photos, videos, and historical archives.
The Setup:
Ethan visits the Montague family attic, located in their now-dilapidated estate, which is up for sale. He

searches through dusty boxes, collecting old photographs, campaign speeches, and a battered leather-
bound collection of writings, newsreels, and articles belonging to his late great-grandfather, Charles

Montague III. Among these artifacts, he also discovers heirlooms containing traces of DNA. Nervously,
Ethan submits these materials, along with his own DNA sample, to the Family Reunion AI service. Later,
with trepidation and excitement, he logs into his first VR session.
First AI Experience:
Ethan is transported to a lavish summer party at the Montague family estate in the 1940s. Guests in
elegant attire mingle on the sprawling lawn, laughing, sipping cocktails, and playing touch football. The
music and chatter blend seamlessly, bringing the scene to life. For the first time, Ethan meets his great
grandparents, Charles and Eleanor Montague, recreated in stunning detail by the AI. They greet him
warmly, as though he were a long-lost relative finally coming home. The experience is surreal,
emotionally overwhelming, and hauntingly real. In this moment, Ethan feels a profound connection to
the Montague legacy that had always felt out of reach. He can’t wait for more such events he now can
attend through the miracle of VR.
ACT TWO: Uncovering a Dark Secret
The Journal’s Revelation:
Ethan always looking for more material to feed into the system uploads an old journal into the AI
system, one that belonged to his father when he was just 12 years old. As the AI processes the entries, it
identifies cryptic references to a missing servant, Anna Davenport, who disappeared following a
Montague gala. Later, Anna was found dead with a broken neck, her death officially ruled as an accident.
However, Ethan’s father’s journal entries cast a shadow over the incident, hinting at the possibility of
foul play. The notes suggest a tension-filled evening, but the details are fragmented and overshadowed
by Charles Montague III’s triumphant campaign season. Intrigued, Ethan allows the AI to cross-reference
the journal with news clippings, archival footage, and other records from that time.

The Suspicious Relative:
Ethan shares his findings with his cousin, Victoria Montague, a polished and ambitious politician
running for a Senate seat. Victoria dismisses the AI’s findings as speculative and insists their family’s
legacy should remain untarnished. She urges Ethan to focus on the brighter aspects of their history. But
Ethan can’t shake the feeling she knows more than she lets on.
The AI’s Breakthrough:
The AI reconstructs the events of the fateful night using available data. In a chilling VR recreation, Ethan
witnesses Anna confronting Charles Montague about unpaid wages and a possible affair. The scene ends
with a violent struggle, suggesting Anna’s death was covered up to protect Charles’ reputation.
The Turning Point:
Ethan realizes the truth could devastate Victoria’s political campaign and destroy the Montague name
forever. But he also feels a moral obligation to reveal the injustice. His growing determination to expose
the truth makes him a threat.
ACT THREE: Danger and Confrontation
The Threat Escalates:
Ethan narrowly survives a suspicious car accident after confronting Victoria about her knowledge of the
crime. He begins to piece together her desperation to protect the family legacy and suspects she
orchestrated the attack. Fearful yet resolute, Ethan decides to upload the AI’s findings to a public
database.
The Climax:
In a final VR session, Ethan reconstructs the full truth: Charles Montague had an affair with Anna
Davenport, resulting in a child born out of wedlock. When Anna threatened to expose the truth, Charles
killed her during an altercation. The Montague family conspired to cover up the crime to preserve their
legacy. The AI further identifies a potential witness who could corroborate the findings—a family
chauffeur who has remained in hiding for years.
Before Ethan can act, Victoria confronts him at the Montague estate, now a state museum reminiscent of
Hearst Castle. She demands that he destroy all evidence, arguing that exposing the truth would tarnish
the family name and devastate her political ambitions. Their argument escalates into a physical struggle,
uncannily mirroring the VR recreation of the fateful night between Charles and Anna. In a tragic twist,
Ethan meets the same fate as Anna, tumbling down the estate’s iconic staircase to his death.
The Resolution:
Victoria succeeds in silencing Ethan, but unbeknownst to her, Ethan has been meticulously documenting
his findings during his AI VR sessions, writing copious notes as if preparing a reporter’s exposé. Just
before his death, the VR program finishes uploading to the cloud, bypassing a court-ordered injunction
filed by Victoria—the sole surviving member of the storied Montague family. Victoria, convinced she has
eliminated all evidence, smugly burns the only remaining physical copy of the incriminating journal,
believing she has won the battle.
However, as if following its own directive, the AI mainframe—programmed with Ethan’s last
instructions—continues cross-referencing mountains of data. In its analysis, it uncovers the identity of
the long-missing chauffeur, now deceased, Andrew Caplet. The AI not only identifies him but also
connects critical details: Andrew had adopted Anna Davenport’s daughter after her disappearance and

vanished from public view. Furthermore, using DNA from Ethan’s submitted artifacts (such as brushes
and family heirlooms), the AI confirms a match to Anna’s adopted daughter.
The final scene mirrors the iconic ending of All the President’s Men. A computer screen flickers as the AI
compiles photographs, dates, and timelines, methodically piecing together the puzzle.
In a climactic moment, the AI reveals the name of the adopted daughter, Charlize Caplet Larson—who is
revealed to be the current Attorney General of Utah. Charlize’s name and email address illuminates the
monitor, creating an email with the evidence, leaving the audience with the powerful implication that
justice will finally be served. AI hits “Send” as the screen fades to black
