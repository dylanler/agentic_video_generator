Unlock the full potential of Dream Machine with these best practices to ensure your creative journey is smooth, efficient, and inspiring.



Use natural language for prompting
When crafting your text prompts, think of them as a conversation with Dream Machine. Describe what you want in natural, detailed language:

Good: "The cover of a magazine, cyberpunk fashion"

Better: "A magazine cover showcasing high fashion with cyberpunk elements"

Be specific about the style, mood, lighting, or elements you want to see. Adding adjectives and clear descriptors helps the model generate more accurate and tailored results. Don’t be afraid to ask for products, magazine covers, and more! You can also ask for text in your generations, by specifying in your prompt something like: a poster with text that reads "Dream Machine". Don't be afraid to ask for bold and unusual text styles - the sky's the limit!

Use advanced features to refine
Leverage Dream Machine’s advanced tools to go beyond the basics:

Modify: Adjust your visuals by describing specific changes. For example: "Make the colors warmer and add more trees."

Styles: Apply predefined aesthetics like Anime or Cinematic to align your visuals with your desired mood.

Character Reference: Create consistent and personalized characters. Simply upload your image, then type "@character" followed by your prompt.

Visual Reference: Upload an image as a style guide for object design. Simply upload your image, then type "@style" followed by a prompt of your choosing.

Camera Motion: Add cinematic movement to videos with options like Pan, Orbit, or Zoom.

Extend & Keyframes: Smoothly lengthen your videos with transitions toward a new visual target.

Loop: Simply type "loop" or "looping video" along with your desired image to create loops as well.

These tools let you fine-tune and iterate until your creation aligns perfectly with your vision.



Leverage context retention
Dream Machine retains context within a board, meaning it "remembers" your earlier generations and builds upon them.

As you continue creating, the AI will follow along with your ideas, allowing you to refine and expand on concepts cohesively.

Ask for ideas by saying, “Help me with ideas” for even more inspiration! For example, start with a simple prompt ("A peaceful meadow") and evolve it into a story-like progression with related prompts like:

"Add a golden hour glow."

"Include a small cottage in the distance."

"Transition into a starry night with fireflies."

“Help me with more ideas”

This contextual understanding makes your boards dynamic and collaborative. Feel free to ask for ideas, stories, characters, and more!

Iterate and explore your workflow
Experiment with different workflows to find what works best for you:

Iterative Generations: Start with a broad idea, then refine and modify as you go.

Collaborative Remixing: Use tools like Brainstorm or More Like This to expand on ideas and remix visuals with collaborators.

Board Organization: Group similar ideas and concepts within boards for a cohesive project experience.

Feel free to try various approaches and explore Dream Machine’s features to discover unique conclusions that suit your creative style.



Stick to aesthetic keywords
As you explore, take note of keywords that consistently produce results you like. For example, terms like "minimalist," "surreal," or "watercolor" may resonate with your aesthetic preferences.

Reuse these keywords across prompts to maintain a consistent visual style for your projects.

By aligning prompts and features with your aesthetic preferences, you can create a portfolio of visuals that feel cohesive and professional.



Collaborate and share
Dream Machine’s sharing features let you easily collaborate and gain inspiration:

Share boards or individual images/videos with collaborators via a link.

Remix shared content to build on others’ ideas or refine your own concepts further.

Collaboration can open up new creative avenues and push your projects in exciting directions.

These best practices will help you make the most of Dream Machine, whether you’re starting a new project, iterating on ideas, or refining your style. Let your creativity flow and discover what’s possible!
